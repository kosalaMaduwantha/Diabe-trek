### Research Team
 - Kosala Maduwantha
 - Kosala Disanayake
 - Sajani Mayadunne
 - Vishwa Gunathilake

### Main Objective
 - Self-care mobile application for diet planning with POC monitoring features to support a patient with prediabetes, type 2 diabetes or type2 diabetes-based vascular complications. 

### Main Research Questions
 - What is type2 Diabetes?
 - How to utilize self-care management for patients with diabetes?
 - What are the main features to consider when creating a tool to manage diabetes

### Indivitual Objectives
 - Using still image processing techniques and machine learning to analyze the nutrients content on a meal with a suggested amount to consume based on the diabetes condition.

 - Using machine learning and optimization methods to create personalized physical routines, changing the intensity of the routines using reinforcement learning and analyze the physical health.

 - Using Machine learning techniques to predict most accurate possibility of a patient having diabetic neuropathy.

 - Using still image processing techniques and machine learning to detect DFU stage and to predict its progress or regress.
